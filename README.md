	13、珍惜这爱情，如珍惜着宝藏，轻轻地走进这情感的圣殿，去感受每一刻美妙时光。
　　文笔山在丽江古城西南七八公里处，她像一把黑剑似地耸立着，她是一座海拔三千四百多米的山峰，它与北面的玉岳遥遥相对，文笔山尖尖的峰形恰似一支蓝天疾书的巨笔，故名文笔山。据说，丽江之所以文墨昌盛、人才辈出，就是因为沾了文笔山、文笔海的“灵气”。著名的藏传佛教圣地文峰寺，就巍巍峨峨地坐落在风景秀丽的文笔山腹地。相传，迦叶尊者来东土时，一下看中了丽江的这座文笔山，他就在文笔山讲经说法，还把一把能够启开鸡足山大门的神秘无比的钥匙也留在了文笔山中。　　　文笔山不仅青山绿水，林木繁茂，而且坐西朝东，抱气界风，实在是一块福地圣土。东临丽江古城，历历在目；北面一派毫无遮拦的茫茫苍苍，田畴平川尽头是积玉堆琼的玉岳神峰。四时可以品味，春之迷离艳冶，群蝶仙舞；夏之葱郁苍翠，凄凄芳草；秋之锦华明净，百鸟唱颂；冬之朴素晶莹，禅林森森。文笔山古树名木参天蔽日，密密匝匝的是几人合抱的水冬瓜树和杉树，在这些大树的丛林里，无数山泉从岩隙和大树根底泉涌而出，潺潺汩汩，融汇成美妙溪流，这水神采奕奕、金声玉音、妙不可言。丽江的每一个人都把文笔山的泉水讲得神乎其神，说这泉实属仙水神液，倍胜灵丹妙药。有这样的历史事实：纳西人过去把文笔山形容成“若金形古”意思是抚养独儿子的好地方，主要指的就是要让独儿独女喝这股圣液好水，以保无虞。当年，高僧大德贡嘎大师前往东土，就是在这片禅意幽幽佛缘悠悠的文笔深林的禅泉边盘坐了半年，才离开丽江，后来不知所归。那时，丽江的一位自号“铁旦葩”的文人，还是未及弱冠的少儿，他的父母看着这个瘦小羸弱的独苗苗，分外耽心，就把他送到了文笔山的这片神奇的丛林之中，托付给了禅院。带领这文弱小子的喇嘛却把小子的红被子拿给贡嘎活佛打坐，那贡嘎活佛和纳西小子一起喝了不少文笔圣水。后来，这铁旦葩尽管瘦骨峋嶙，居然也活了八十多岁，还写下了几篇极具个性的好诗文。　　　再也没有比陶醉在文笔山的花天草地、古木丛林和神泉圣水之中更畅快的事情了；说老实话，一到文笔山，很少有人想下山想回家去，谁想离开仙境去重新领受那种尘世间无处不在的苟且与纷争的煎熬呢？当然，想是这么想，但绝对的超凡脱俗是不可能的，归还得归回各自应该回归的地方，只是文笔山在你的心中画上了自然、清醒、恬淡与禅悟的一笔。从此你的心中，终于有了一袭力避尘嚣、意境高远、生机无限的领地。

13, cherish the love, cherish the treasure, went into the house of the emotional gently to feel wonderful time every moment.
